# Speech Recognition Versoin 1

## Description

* This application utilizes a user's microphone to listen to speech and converts that speech to text. This application was written in HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, and JavaScript. The Talk button is active and the End button is inactive when the application is not listening. When the application is listening, a user can either stop talking or press the End button to cease recording. The Talk button will become active again once the application is not listening.
